Quick Funny button webpage template I came up with that demonstrates my ability with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

You can change the images as you want, you have to download the audio on your pc for the audio to work.

If you click on a image, the corresponding audio plays, you can also filter each image by the tool bar on the top. There is P for peter from family guy, M for miscellaneous, and R for resident evil.

Here is the website https://connora711.github.io/Funny-button-website-template/Button%20website/front_page.html
